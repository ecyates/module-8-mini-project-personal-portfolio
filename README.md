# Module 7 - Mini-Project - Personal Portfolio
Author: Elizabeth Yates

In this Personal Portfolio project, I embarked on an exciting journey to create a captivating and informative online showcase of your skills, experiences, and interests. This personal portfolio website serves as a digital canvas to express my creativity and showcase my talent to the world.

## Project Requirements

My Personal Portfolio Showcases the following the pages: 

### Home Page

- The main landing page that provides an introduction to me and my portfolio.
- Includes my name, a profile picture,  and a welcome message.

### About Me Page

- Provides a professional summary and a personal summary

### Projects Page

- Showcases my past projects, images, links to my repository
- Includes my work history and education history

### Skills Page

- Highlights my technical skills, languages, frameworks, and software proficiency.
- I also added some personal interests/skills. 

### Contact Page

- Included a contact form and a thank you page for when it's submitted.
- My email address and links to your social media profiles are in the footer on every page, so I didn't add it just here.
