            <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
            <p>Adaptable and bilingual professional with a background in financial editing, process automation, 
            and data-driven problem-solving, now transitioning into software engineering through Coding Temple's 
            intensive bootcamp. Skilled in leveraging analytical and technical expertise, with hands-on experience in 
            Python, SQL, VBA, and workflow automation. Passionate about bringing a unique blend of language and 
            programming skills to build innovative, efficient solutions. </p>

            <h3>Personal Summary</h3>
            <p>After more than a decade of incredible life experiences abroad, I'm taking a leap into a long-held dream 
            by enrolling in Coding Temple's Software Engineering program. My journey here has been anything but straightforward, 
            starting 15 years ago in college with a double major in Mathematics and Spanish Literature. 
            Although I initially set my sights on teaching, an Intro to Computer Science course I took unexpectedly 
            hooked me with its perfect blend of language and problem-solving, sparking a love for programming that 
            I carried with me as I explored other paths.</p>

            <p>When graduation arrived, I chose to follow a different dream: travel. I moved to Chile to teach 
                English, where, in my first two weeks, I met the love of my life. 
                Together, we spent a year exploring 15 countries, culminating in a proposal at the Taj Mahal 
                (if you'd like to see more about our travels, see <a href="2016-travel-blog.html">here</a>) and ultimately building a life in coastal Chile, where we married (three times!) and welcomed our two children.</p>
                
            <p>In Chile, I found a rewarding role as a financial editor that harnessed my love for language, detail, 
                and tech-savvy problem-solving. Over my six years at Evalueserve, I trained in VBA, created 
                automations, and consolidated workflows across various platformsâ€”all the while growing my 
                technical skills and refining my professional focus.</p>
                
            <p>But with each passing year, my heart tugged me back toward home in the Pacific Northwest. 
                After a decade in Chile, my family and I finally relocated to Portland, where I now get to 
                share daily life with my parents and siblings. It's been a year of growth, adaptation, and 
                fresh starts, including joining Coding Temple to pursue a software engineering career. 
                I feel incredibly fortunate to be back at home, alongside my kids' first steps into school 
                and daycare, and embracing my own exciting new chapter in tech.</p>
                
            <p>Wish me luck on this next adventure! ðŸš€</p>
