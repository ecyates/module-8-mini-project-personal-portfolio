            <p>Love is in the air and I'm in the mood to tell the story of how I fell in love with my 
                favorite person in the world, Cristóbal freaking Berríos. So here it goes!</p>

            <p>Two years ago, almost exactly, I came to Chile with a visa in my passport, 
                crazy nerves and a whole lot of excitement. The rush of anxiety was a lot to deal with 
                as I struggled to find an apartment and start my job as an English professor at a university 
                without any training and on top of all this, I couldn't seem to find any good coffee in the whole city.  
                When I discovered most people drank instant coffee or Nescafe from a machine, the search was on for some 
                decent caffeination.</p>
                
            <p></p>On my way to work, I noticed a cute little café, called Spantatuto. I don't know why, 
            but I was simultaneously drawn to it and nervous to go in, like I would embarrass myself. 
            I still wasn't confident in my Chilean Spanish and I found the quaintness of the café intimidating. 
            On the Friday of my first week, I walked past after my last class and, although it was closed, 
            I noticed a chalkboard posted on the window.</p>
            </div>    
        <figure>
            <img class="travel-img" src="../travel-blog-images/image-2.jpg"
            alt="A black board in the window of Spantatuto Cafe that reads 'Lord, give me coffee to change the things I can, and wine to accept the things I can't. Cheers :)'">
            <figcaption><i>The black board in the window of Spantatuto Cafe.</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div>
            <p>I felt like this board completely described my life in that moment of stress and totally made my day. 
                I went on to post this Facebook and my blog and went on about it for days. 
                I made a promise to myself that I would go in on my break the next week. </p>

            <p>Finally the next week, I went into the café. Sitting behind the counter was a scruffy guy in his early 30s. 
                When I came up to him, our eyes met and he smiled and I relaxed a little bit. 
                He had the air of comfortable in his own skin to the point that it puts you at ease. 
                I ordered a cortado (espresso with milk) and waited awkwardly at the counter. 
                He told me I could sit and he'd bring it to me. 
                I chose a seat in the corner that had a view of the entrance and I pulled out my book. 
                This is my favorite way to start the day: morning coffee and a book. 
                I could do this for hours. He brought me the cortado, which had a little flower design in the foam. 
                When I tried it, the coffee entered my soul and I knew I'd found my new regular place. 
                Cris's favorite detail is that I left him a tip (not a social requirement at cafes in Chile) 
                not just that day, but every day I came by. </p>
            </div>

            <figcaption><i>The flower design in my cortado and the sugar dispenser.</i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div>
            <p>I went back to Spantatuto every time I could and slowly, Cris and I struck up a friendship. 
                One day he asked me if I like cinnamon in my coffee. Another day he came up to me and showed me a card trick &ndash; 
                he's a budding magician. One day, he decided he wanted to experiment with different coffee concoctions, 
                and we shared them over conversation. When he revealed to me that he spoke English because he'd lived in Canada 
                for five years, we'd speak a lot more in English, and I became more animated in our time together. 
                Sometimes, he'd come over, and we'd talk, and other days he'd just let me be.</p>
            <p>The sparks there were pretty obvious, but I had several reservations about starting anything with the guy 
                I started calling my 'coffeeman'. First, if things didn't work out, where would I get my coffee? 
                We all know the expression, “Don't shit where you eat,” and I didn't know if I was willing to risk it. 
                Second, the age difference of 12 years seemed like a lot to me. We're in two completely different places in life, 
                and what could it lead to? </p>
            <p>His reservations were a bit different. After having had bad experiences dating foreigners in the past, 
                the instant I walked in, he told himself he wasn't going to start up with a gringa only to be hurt again.</p> 
            <p>A couple months passed with our continued, but hesitant friendship. A few events started to change my mind.  
                He showed me one day his plans to travel the world, and I thought maybe we are in the same place at the same time, 
                despite our age difference. A couple times we ran into each other on the street, and the electricity between us 
                was positively palpable. And then one day, I had a half-day at work, and I came by the café. 
                We talked for three hours about anything and everything (mainly aliens and ghosts haha!). 
                Walking away, I couldn't deny the chemistry. </p>
            <p>The next weekend, I was out with my friend Natalie. Between the two of us, we'd had lots to drink and 
                felt like doing something that night. We searched our mind and our contacts trying to think of what to do 
                when it occurred to me: “I bet my coffeeman would know where we could go out dancing.” 
                A hop, skip, Whatsapp and phone call later, Natalie, Cris, Natalie's roommate and I were out at a club. </p>
            <p>What I loved about the beginning of our relationship is that Cris and I never played games. 
                There was no, “How does he feel? Why doesn't she call me?” crap on either end. 
                We fit easily into each other's lives like puzzle pieces. We fell in love quickly, and 
                within 6 months all of our reservations were put to an end. </p>

        <div>
            <p>Cris was offered a job as the office manager at a big mining company and took it. 
                I finished my 10-month contract at the university and decided to stay in Chile for Cris 
                and for his great job opportunity. After going home for Christmas, I came back and found a job 
                as a receptionist at a shipping company. He sold the café and worked his butt off at that terrible 
                soul-sucking job. In November of 2015, the mining industry went to hell in a hand basket, 
                as the price of copper dropped and Cris, along with hundreds of other employees, was let go. 
                After a week of enjoying his unemployment and taking a much-needed vacation, he told me: 
                "Let's go travel the world. All of it. Let's make that dream of ours come true."</p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter, I quit my job and decided to take a trip of a lifetime. I can't believe 
                I get to do it with my love, my best friend, my teammate and partner. </p>

        <h2>The End</h2><hr>
        <p>We hope that you enjoyed sharing in our story. Now, eight years later, our shared lives have only continued
            to bring us new adventures and challenges. After getting engaged at the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, we got
            married once (in Portland, OR), twice (in Talca, Chile), and three times (in Fairhope, AL). We moved back
            to Chile, relocating to the Valparaiso region on the coast and had two beautiful children, Dante and Amaya. 
            And in March 2024, we took the leap to move to Portland, OR, where we're starting over again. Amor, I have
            to say, it's been a pleasure doing life with you. To the moon, ida y vuelta, te amo!
